# Python examples

Demo scripts for the `hypercube-wtf` API. They call only the installed package.

| Script | What it shows |
|--------|----------------|
| [`synthetic_classification.py`](synthetic_classification.py) | Multi-class length-N fields → `fit` → train / test accuracy |

## How to run

These files live in the GitHub repository. They are not part of `pip install`
— use the [Quick start](../README.md#quick-start) if you only want a snippet.

From a clone of HypercubeWTF (repository root), after installing the package:

```bash
pip install hypercube-wtf
# or from this tree:  pip install .
python python/examples/synthetic_classification.py
```

## What these are not

- **Not** the C++ demos (`wtf_synth`, `wtf_mnist`) or the MNIST study write-ups.
  Those live under [`examples/`](../../examples/).
- **Not** automated tests. Package tests are [`tests/test_basic.py`](../tests/test_basic.py).
- **Not** hard tasks. Synthetic multi-class fields are easy onboarding so the
  episode API is obvious; do not cite their metrics as research results.
